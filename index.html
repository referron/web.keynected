				<h4>The Information we collect:</h4>				
				<p>Mobifilliate Pty Ltd, ABN: 90 158 355 607, of Level 7, 14 Martin Place, Sydney NSW 2000 (“KEYNECTED”) licenses its product. KEYNECTED only collects the information necessary for us to do business with you. All the information we hold has been either knowingly offered to us by you or can be found on the public record (e.g.: telephone directories, the ASX etc).</p>
				<p>When you visit our website some information is automatically collected relating to the electronic addresses of devices used in accessing the website (e.g. IP addresses of servers), domain name, date and time of visit, pages viewed and information downloaded. We also utilise “cookies” which allow us to serve you better when you revisit the website. By using this website, you authorise us to use such information for purposes connected with KEYNECTED’s business and in our performance of the services offered by KEYNECTED.</p>
				<p>Further, by using this website and any services provided through it, you acknowledge and agree that any personal information we hold about you may be electronically hosted in, the country where you are accessing this Website or transferred to, such overseas countries include, without limitation,
				Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Europe, UK,  USA, South America, South Africa and Australia.</p>
				<p>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</p>
				<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our website, apps, or other services (“KEYNECTED” or “Service”) or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use KEYNECTED. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use KEYNECTED after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</p>
				<h5>Sharing Your Content and Information</h5>
				<p>You own all of the content and information you post on KEYNECTED, For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with KEYNECTED (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
				<p>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
				<p>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of KEYNECTED, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
